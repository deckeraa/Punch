\section{ Log Time }
\subsection{ Programming Assignment }
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The developer receives a programming assignment.
    \item The developer issues a command to Punch telling it to start clocking time.
    \item Since the project is his third assignment in the class so far, the developer tells Punch to track the time
          under the name ``Program 3''.
    \item The developer copies down the relevant files from the assignment so that the developer can begin the assignment.
          The developer also sets up a project folder and the necessary things to start such as a Makefile.
    \item Since the time was not spent coding but was spent setting up the project, the developer tells Punch to 
          mark the time spent as ``Project Set-up''.
    \item However, the developer does not wish to quit working yet and tells Punch to merely mark a division in the time spent
          on ``Program 3''.
    \item After slamming out the code, the developer decides to take a break. 
          The developer tells Punch to log the time as ``Coding'' and punches out.
