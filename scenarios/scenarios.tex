\section{ Log Time }
\subsection{ Programming Assignment }
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The developer receives a programming assignment.
    \item The developer issues a command to Punch telling it to start clocking time.
    \item Since the project is his third assignment in the class so far, the developer tells Punch to track the time
          under the name ``Program 3''.
    \item The developer also tells Punch to categorize ``Program 3'' under ``Programming'', so that the common sub-activities
          that the developer configured earlier, such as ``Project Set-up'' or ``Coding'' will be easily reachable.
    \item The developer copies down the relevant files from the assignment so that the developer can begin the assignment.
          The developer also sets up a project folder and the necessary things to start such as a Makefile.
    \item Since the time was not spent coding but was spent setting up the project, the developer tells Punch to 
          mark the time spent as ``Project Set-up''.
    \item However, the developer does not wish to quit working yet and tells Punch to merely mark a division in the time spent
          on ``Program 3''.
    \item After slamming out the code, the developer decides to take a break. 
          The developer tells Punch to log the time as ``Coding'' and punches out.
    \item The developer punches back in and starts to debug the code.
    \item After working out all the bugs, the developer submits the programming assignment.
    \item The developer punches out and tells punch to tab the time as ``Debugging''.
        \end{enumerate}

\section{ Analyze Logs }
\subsection{ Programming Assignment }
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The developer has finished a programming assignment for school known as ``Program 3''.
    \item The developer tells Punch to create a pie graph showing the different components of ``Program 3'' as a function of
          time spent. The developer knows that this data will be useful for refining a Personal Software Process.
    \end{enumerate}
